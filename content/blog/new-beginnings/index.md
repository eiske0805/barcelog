Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

プロ野球 西武の平良海馬投手が、1 日夜行われたソフトバンク戦で 9 回の 1 イニングを無失点に抑え、プロ野球新記録となる 39 試合連続無失点を達成しました。

平良投手は、先月 28 日の試合で 9 回の 1 イニングを無失点に抑えて、15 年前の平成 18 年に当時阪神の藤川球児さんがマークしたプロ野球記録に並ぶ、38 試合連続無失点を達成しました。

そして 1 日夜、福岡市の PayPay ドームで行われたソフトバンク戦で、1 対 0 の 9 回に 2 人目のピッチャーとしてマウンドに上がりました。

平良投手は、先頭バッターを空振り三振で打ち取ったあと、2 人目の柳田悠岐選手にヒットを打たれて、その後 2 アウト二塁となりましたが、後続を抑えて、プロ野球新記録となる 39 試合連続無失点を達成しました。

平良投手は沖縄県出身の 21 歳。最速 160 キロのストレートとキレのある変化球を持ち味に、昨シーズンはリーグ 2 位の 33 ホールドをあげて新人王に輝きました。

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text

made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
